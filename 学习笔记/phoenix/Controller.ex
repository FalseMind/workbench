  # The first parameter is always conn, a struct which holds information about
  # the request such as the host, path elements, port, query string, and much
  # more. conn, comes to Phoenix via Elixirâ€™s Plug middleware framework.

  # any parameters passed along in the HTTP request. It is a good practice to
  # pattern match against params in the function signature to provide data in a
  # simple package we can pass on to rendering.
